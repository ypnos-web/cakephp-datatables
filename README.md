## IMPORTANT -- SECURITY

The original code by fheider is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, which was made apparent by a recent
[addition to the CakePHP documentation](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/b2b45af37f807068f6c23f152fe6e5bf64656915).
The vulnerability is fixed by a [breaking change](https://github.com/ypnos-web/cakephp-datatables/commit/81929ad62d1e4041d00c1904f67771fec04ecd5f)
in all branches in this repository. It affects the ordering and filtering functionality of DataTables in conjunction with
server-side processing. If you are using a prior version of this plugin, you need to update it immediately and, if needed, change your code to
[allow ordering and filtering with server-side processing](https://github.com/ypnos-web/cakephp-datatables/wiki/Quick-Start#enable-dynamic-filters-and-ordering).

## About

[DataTables](https://www.datatables.net) is a jQuery plugin for intelligent HTML tables. Next to adding dynamic elements to the table, it also has great supports for on-demand data fetching and server-side processing.

It consists of a helper to add DataTables to your view and a Component to transparently process AJAX requests made by DataTables.
